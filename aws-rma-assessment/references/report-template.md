## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1 (0-3 months): Critical Risk Mitigation

**Priority**: P0

| Q ID | Improvement Item | Current->Target | AWS Service Recommendation | Est. Effort | Est. Cost |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| 27 | Implement DR strategy | 1->3 | Aurora Global DB, Route 53 | 2-3 weeks | +$1500/mo |

### Phase 2 (3-6 months): Important Improvements

**Priority**: P1

{Similar format}

### Phase 3 (6-12 months): Maturity Uplift

**Priority**: P2 + P3

{Similar format}

---

## AWS Service Recommendations

Based on gap analysis, the following AWS services are recommended:

| Service | Purpose | Addresses | Est. Monthly Cost |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| AWS Resilience Hub | Automated resilience assessment | Q38 | $0 (per-assessment billing) |
| AWS FIS | Chaos engineering testing | Q62-68 | ~$100/mo |
| CloudWatch Synthetics | Synthetic monitoring | Q17 | ~$50/mo |

## Detailed Q&A Records

### P0 - Critical Questions

#### Question 1: How do you define recovery objectives for your application?
- **Answer**: {user's answer}
- **Maturity Level**: {1/2/3}
- **Assessment Basis**: {rationale for the level}
- **Improvement Recommendation**: {specific advice if not Level 3}

{Detailed records for all questions}

## Next Steps

For domains scoring Level 1, the following deep-dive analyses are recommended using `aws-resilience-modeling`:

| Domain at Level 1 | Recommended Modeling Task | Focus Area |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Disaster Recovery | Task 2 (Failure Modes) + Task 4 (Business Impact) | DR strategy validation and business impact analysis |
| High Availability | Task 1 (Component Mapping) + Task 2 (Failure Modes) | Architecture dependency and fault tolerance analysis |
| Observability | Task 1 (Component Mapping) + Task 3 (Resilience Assessment) | Monitoring gap identification and scoring |

This assessment should be paired with `aws-resilience-modeling` for a complete risk mitigation lifecycle.

## Scoring Alignment Reference

| RMA Level | Approximate Modeling Stars | Description |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Level 1 (Ad-hoc) | 1-2 stars | Informal/no process |
| Level 2 (Defined) | 2.5-3.5 stars | Basic processes exist |
| Level 3 (Managed) | 4-5 stars | Mature, automated, continuously improved |

*Note: This is an approximate mapping. The two assessments evaluate different dimensions and granularity.*

## HTML Report Generation

After generating the Markdown report, **also generate by default** an interactive HTML report.

**Recommended Method: Using the Interactive HTML Template**

Use the pre-built HTML template (`../assets/html-report-template.html`), which includes:
- AWS brand design style (orange theme)
- Chart.js interactive charts (radar, doughnut, bar, scatter)
- Responsive design supporting mobile and print
- Color-coded risk cards

**Generation Steps**:

Use the Write tool, referencing the `assets/html-report-template.html` structure, to populate assessment data into the HTML:

```python
# Data population example
assessment_data = {
    "projectName": "{application name}",
    "assessmentDate": "{assessment date}",
    "overallScore": {overall score percentage},

    # 10 domain maturity scores
    "domainScores": {
        "recoveryObjectives": {recovery objectives score},
        "observability": {observability score},
        "disasterRecovery": {disaster recovery score},
        "highAvailability": {high availability score},
        "changeManagement": {change management score},
        "incidentManagement": {incident management score},
        "operationalReviews": {operational reviews score},
        "chaosEngineering": {chaos engineering score},
        "gameDays": {game days score},
        "organizationalLearning": {organizational learning score}
    },

    # Risk distribution
    "riskDistribution": {
        "high": {high risk count},
        "medium": {medium risk count},
        "low": {low risk count}
    },

    # Key findings and improvement recommendations
    "keyFindings": [...],
    "improvementRoadmap": [...]
}
```

Populate the above data into the corresponding placeholders in the HTML template, generating file: `{application-name}-rma-assessment-{date}.html`

**Alternative Method: Basic Conversion with Pandoc**

```bash
pandoc {report-file}.md \
  -f gfm \
  -t html5 \
  --standalone \
  --toc \
  --toc-depth=3 \
  --css=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/github-markdown-css@5/github-markdown.min.css \
  --metadata title="RMA Resilience Assessment Report" \
  -o {report-file}-basic.html
```
