# EKS Resiliency Checks

## Overview

The EKS Resiliency Checker is a comprehensive tool that evaluates Amazon EKS clusters against 28 critical resiliency best practices. It performs automated checks across three main categories: Application workloads, Control Plane configuration, and Data Plane setup. The tool provides detailed findings, compliance status, and actionable remediation guidance for each check.

## Check Categories

### Application Related Checks (A1-A14)
These checks focus on application workload resilience and operational best practices.

### Control Plane Related Checks (C1-C5)
These checks evaluate the EKS control plane configuration for security, monitoring, and scalability.

### Data Plane Related Checks (D1-D7)
These checks assess worker node configuration, resource management, and cluster infrastructure.
