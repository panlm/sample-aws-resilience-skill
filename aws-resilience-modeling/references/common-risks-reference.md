## 1. Storage Risks

### 1.1 EBS (Elastic Block Store)

| Risk ID | Risk Point | Root Cause | Improvement Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Storage-Risk-1 | EBS gp3 I/O latency spikes | gp3 I/O latency sometimes rises above 10ms, potentially lasting minutes to tens of minutes, affecting application performance | Upgrade to io2 for I/O latency-sensitive applications (2 orders of magnitude more consistent than gp3); migrate self-managed MySQL to Aurora (distributed storage, not EBS); build application-layer HA to switch to standby node when latency reaches threshold |
| Storage-Risk-2 | EBS Volume corruption/loss | Volume corruption leads to unrecoverable data loss | For RPO=0 workloads, configure multi-replica at application layer distributed across AZs with multi-replica write confirmation; use DLM for periodic volume backups; use AWS Backup for periodic EBS backups |
| Storage-Risk-3 | Snapshot-created EBS Volume initialization performance | Volumes created from snapshots have high read/write latency (tens of ms) before full initialization | Enable FSR (Fast Snapshot Restore); use FIO sequential reads to trigger proactive initialization |
| Storage-Risk-4 | Lack of EBS I/O fault simulation tools | No methods/tools to simulate EBS Volume I/O latency spikes/stops | Use AWS FIS to inject I/O pause on EBS Volumes (seconds to hours), verify if upper-layer applications can correctly failover |
| Storage-Risk-5 | EBS Volume performance not meeting preset targets | Volume performance (IOPS/throughput) doesn't meet targets when application workload increases | EC2 instances have I/O performance limits; when cumulative multi-volume performance reaches the limit, upgrade EC2 instance type; monitor ec2_instance_ebs_performance_exceeded_iops metric |

### 1.2 S3

| Risk ID | Risk Point | Root Cause | Improvement Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Storage-Risk-6 | S3 objects deleted or overwritten without recovery | Users cannot recover original data when objects are deleted or overwritten | Enable S3 Versioning; consider enabling Object Lock to prevent old version deletion |
| Storage-Risk-9 | S3 high-concurrency 503 errors | 503 errors during high-concurrency reads/writes | S3 has 3500 PUT/5500 GET limits per prefix; distribute requests across different prefixes; add hash strings or attributes to prefixes; add retry logic in code |

### 1.3 EFS

| Risk ID | Risk Point | Root Cause | Improvement Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Storage-Risk-7 | EFS billing spikes | Elastic Throughput mode charges by traffic, generating high costs during extended peak periods | Switch to Provisioned Throughput mode when peak periods exceed 5% of the time |

### 1.4 FSx

| Risk ID | Risk Point | Root Cause | Improvement Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Storage-Risk-8 | FSx periodic performance degradation | I/O affected during maintenance windows (software upgrades, security patches) | Choose Multi-region mode to reduce impact (<1 min vs Single-region minutes to 30 min); schedule maintenance windows during business off-peak hours |

### 1.5 DataSync

| Risk ID | Risk Point | Root Cause | Improvement Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Storage-Risk-10 | DataSync generates high S3 request costs | Full scan of source and destination buckets on every job start | Reduce DataSync job frequency; use S3 Replication for bucket synchronization instead |

|---------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| DB-Risk-1 | RDS/Aurora/ElastiCache/DocumentDB | Not using Multi-AZ HA architecture | Cannot handle primary node/single AZ failures | RDS production should use Multi-AZ Instance/Cluster (SLA increases from 99.5% to 99.95%); Multi-AZ Cluster: most failovers <35s; Aurora/ElastiCache/DocumentDB: create at least one cross-AZ replica |
| DB-Risk-2 | RDS/Aurora/ElastiCache/MemoryDB/DocumentDB/DynamoDB | No cross-region architecture | Has cross-region DR requirements but not configured | RDS: create cross-region read replicas; Aurora: use Global Database (replication lag <1s); ElastiCache: use Global Datastore; MemoryDB: use Multi-Region (SLA 99.999%); DynamoDB: use Global Table (supports multi-write) |

### 2.2 Performance and Configuration

| DB-Risk-3 | RDS | Using T-series instances in production | T-series use a credit system; performance degrades when credits are exhausted | Use M/R series for production; R series recommended for high-concurrency (CPU:memory=1:8); use r8g/r7g/r6g Graviton for cost efficiency |
| DB-Risk-4 | RDS | Inappropriate storage type causing latency issues | Latency-sensitive workloads using io1/gp3 | Use io2 storage (supports online storage type conversion); or choose Aurora for lower latency; for replication lag sensitivity, use Aurora (redo-based physical replication) |
| DB-Risk-5 | Aurora/RDS | Version selection issues | Stability-first but chose non-LTS version requiring annual upgrades | LTS versions have at least 3-year lifecycle; Aurora LTS version is 3.04 (as of 2025/02); RDS users can migrate to Aurora LTS |

| DB-Risk-11 | Database | No proper storage space planning | Disk/memory data fills up | Subscribe to storage metrics; enable RDS auto-expansion for disk; configure data eviction policies and TTL for ElastiCache; use cluster mode + AutoScaling/Serverless for large capacity; Aurora >128TB can use Limitless Database/DSQL |
| DB-Risk-12 | Database | Maintenance operations during peak hours | Forced version upgrades cause unexpected interruptions | Proactively monitor version lifecycle notifications; follow upgrade best practices (preparation/testing/plan design/rollback); disable minor version auto-upgrade; schedule during off-peak hours; use blue-green deployment to minimize downtime |
| DB-Risk-13 | Database | No proper data recovery plan | Data accidentally deleted/lost without recovery | RDS/Aurora/DocumentDB: use PITR to restore to any point in time; Aurora: enable Backtrack for in-cluster recovery; AWS Backup for cross-region backup; MemoryDB provides RPO=0 protection for AZ failures |
| DB-Risk-14 | Database | No cost optimization | Costs exceed expectations | Use Graviton series; use RI; consider Serverless for peak/valley workloads; Aurora/DocumentDB: consider IO Optimized when IO costs exceed 25%; ElastiCache: migrate to Valkey to save 20%-33%; consider data tiering when hot data is <20% |
