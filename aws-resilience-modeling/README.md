## Analysis Framework

### Failure Mode Classification

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Single Point of Failure (SPOF) | Critical components lacking redundancy |
| Excessive Latency | Performance bottlenecks and latency issues |
| Excessive Load | Capacity limits and traffic spikes |
| Misconfiguration | Non-compliance with best practices |
| Shared Fate | Tight coupling and lack of isolation |

### Resilience Assessment Dimensions

Uses a **5-star rating system** (1 star = inadequate, 5 stars = excellent) to assess:

- Redundancy design
- AZ fault tolerance
- Timeout and retry strategy
- Circuit breaker mechanism
- Auto-scaling capability
- Configuration safeguards
- Fault isolation
- Backup and recovery mechanism
- AWS best practices compliance

### Risk Priority Scoring

```
Risk Score = (Probability × Business Impact × Detection Difficulty) / Remediation Complexity
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-Commerce Platform
```
Environment:
- Multi-AZ RDS (PostgreSQL)
- ECS Fargate application
- CloudFront + S3 static assets
- ElastiCache Redis

Key Findings:
- RDS single-region (no Aurora Global Database)
- Missing Auto Scaling policies
- No Circuit Breaker configured
- Insufficient monitoring coverage

Recommendations:
- Migrate to Aurora Global Database
- Implement Target Tracking Auto Scaling
- Integrate AWS X-Ray distributed tracing
- Establish quarterly DR drills
```

### Scenario 2: Financial API
```
Environment:
- API Gateway + Lambda
- DynamoDB Global Tables
- Aurora Serverless
- Route 53 health checks

Key Findings:
- Lambda without Reserved Concurrency
- Missing API throttling policies
- SLO/SLI not defined
- No chaos engineering practices

Recommendations:
- Configure Lambda Reserved Concurrency
- Implement API Gateway Usage Plans
- Define 99.99% availability SLO
- Establish weekly chaos experiments
```

## Disaster Recovery Strategy Selection

| Strategy | RTO | RPO | Cost | Applicable Scenarios |
|----------|-----|-----|------|----------------------|
| Backup & Restore | Hours–Days | Hours–Days | $ | Non-critical systems |
| Pilot Light | 10 min–Hours | Minutes | $$ | Important systems |
| Warm Standby | Minutes | Seconds–Minutes | $$$ | Critical business |
| Multi-Site Active-Active | Seconds–Minutes | Seconds | $$$$ | Mission-critical |

## Advanced Features

### Error Budget Management

Based on AWS resilience best practices, calculate and track error budgets:

```
Error Budget = (1 - SLO) × Time Period

Example:
SLO = 99.9% (monthly)
Error Budget = 43.2 minutes/month
```

### Chaos Engineering Experiments

Use AWS FIS for fault injection:

- EC2 instance termination
- Network latency/packet loss
- RDS failover
- AZ unavailability simulation
- CPU/memory stress tests

### Three Pillars of Observability

- **Logs**: CloudWatch Logs + structured logging
- **Metrics**: CloudWatch Metrics + key monitoring indicators
- **Traces**: AWS X-Ray + distributed tracing

## FAQ

### Q: How long does the analysis take?
A: Depends on environment complexity:
- Simple environment (single region, < 10 services): 1–2 hours
- Medium environment (multi-AZ, 10–50 services): 3–5 hours
- Complex environment (multi-region, > 50 services): 1–2 days

### Q: Is AWS account access required?
A: Recommended but not mandatory:
- **With access**: Resources can be scanned automatically for more accurate analysis
- **Without access**: Analysis is based on provided architecture documentation

### Q: Will the analysis incur AWS charges?
A: The analysis itself incurs no charges, but implementing recommendations may include:
- AWS Resilience Hub (free)
- AWS FIS chaos experiments (billed per minute)
- Additional AWS services (e.g., Aurora Global Database)

### Q: How do I implement the recommendations?
A: The analysis report includes:
- Specific architecture improvement diagrams
- AWS CLI commands
- CloudFormation/Terraform code snippets
- Phased implementation roadmap

### Q: Is multi-cloud supported?
A: Currently focused on AWS environments, providing professional resilience assessments based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
